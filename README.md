# Dockerized PHP Website

This is just a boilerplate for a PHP website, running in a dockerized stack. 

## Requirements

You do not need PHP or composer to be installed. All you need to run this stack is:

- `Docker`
- `make`

## Setup

Start with cloning this repository onto a machine with Docker installed.

### Local Development Environment

Run `make local/setup` to initialize. Once the process has finished, you can use any browser to open http://localhost, which is then served by this stack.

### Help menu

Find out what else you can do and run `make` or `make help`.
